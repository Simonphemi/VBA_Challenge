	The analysis focuses on expanding the dataset provided by Steve  to include the entire stock market over the last few years. \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
\cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
In this analysis I \'a0refactored, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. \
	\cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The Refactored code of the VBA script the for loops run faster than the single loop utilized previously in the Module. \
Also the ticker Index was used within every array of the Refactored codes.\
Refactoring code helps with making adjustments to basic codes which could be repurposed towards others avenues. Though in this situation it worked, However refactoring may not always work depending on the order of the Data presented. \
